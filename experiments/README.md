# TODOs
P1
- [x] Overfit on a small dataset
- [x] Measure iid test accuracy on a somewhat larger dataset
- [x] Deduplicate train and test set
- [x] Normalize inputs
- [x] Sanity check test result
- [ ] Measure how much test acc and test loss improve with dataset / model size
- [x] Measure per-program accuracy

P2
- [ ] Work on improving data quality
- [ ] Maybe: include datapoints comprising multiple layers
- [ ] Log full program accuracy on train and test set
